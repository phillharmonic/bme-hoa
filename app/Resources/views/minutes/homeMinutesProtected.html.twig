    <p>
        The Board of Directors of Brandy Mill Estates is required to meet quarterly (once every 
        three months) to address Association business.  The Board Secretary is required to take 
        meeting minutes.  These minutes are published here to provide as much transparency as 
        possible.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Each year, the Board begins with an agenda, or list of objectives, that the association would
        like addressed.  Agenda's are the landing page for each 'year' in the menu to the left.  
        Minutes then are published dynamically as they become available.  
    </p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> personal identifiers are blacked out when discussing accounts (homeowners) that
        are in arrears, when discussing leans, garnishments, and home foreclosures.  This information
        is disclosed only to Board members. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>TODO:</strong> you forgot to think about annual meetings and special meetings.  Include these.
