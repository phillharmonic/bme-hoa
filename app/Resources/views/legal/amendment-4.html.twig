this Fourth Amendment and made a part hereof as though fully re-written herein.</span></p><p class="P14"><span class="T10"/></p><p class="P15"><span class="T8">2.     </span><span class="T5">Defined

of Regulations shall not be assessed against, levied against, and/or collected from or in connection with: (I) any Lot while owned by Declarant, (ii) any Lot while owned by a Builder, (iii) Declarant, and/or (iv) any Builder.  Assessments shall only be levied against Lots owned by Owners on which houses are fully constructed and initially occupied for residential purposes.  From and after the recording of this Fourth Amendment, all Lots owned by Declarant and the Builders shall be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the obligations of the other Owners to pay Annual Assessments and Special Assessments.  The rights of Declarant and the Builders as Members of the Association shall not be affected or limited by the non-payment of Assessments or other amounts as set forth in this Section 4.</span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T8"/></p><p class="P16"><span class="T8">5.     </span><span class="T5">Right to Cover Deficit</span><span class="T8">.     Declarant, in its sole discretion, may elect to pay some or none of the “deficit,” which is the difference between the amount of the Annual Assessments assessed and the amount of actual expenditures of the Association for

subsidy may be made in the form of cash and/or “in kind” contributions of services or materials, or a combination of thereof.  If it is ever determined that Declarant owes any amounts to the Association, those amounts paid or contributed by Declarant to subsidize the Association, whether previously paid to fund the deficit or whether paid after the effective date hereof, shall be applied as a credit in favor of Declarant toward such amounts then owing.</span></p><p class="P16"><span class="T8"/></p><p class="P16"><span class="T8">6.     </span><span class="T5">Effective of
