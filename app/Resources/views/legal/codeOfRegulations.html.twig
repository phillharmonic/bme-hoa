connection with or arising out of any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, civil, criminal, or administrative, of whatever nature, to which he or she is made or threatened to be made a party or in which he or she is necessarily involved, by reason of his being or having been a Trustee or officer of this Association or such other corporation (whether or not he continues to be a Trustee or officer at the time of incurring such expenses), or in connection with any negotiation or settlement thereof or appeal therein, except in relation to matters as to which he or she shall be finally adjudged liable for negligence or guilty or misconduct in the performance of his duties as such Trustee or officer, and provided that indemnification shall be made only if such Trustee or officer is determined in the manner hereinafter provided to have been acting in good faith in which he reasonably believed to be the best interest of the Association and, in any matter the subject of a criminal action, suit, or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.  </p><p class="P52">There shall be included in such indemnification, together with all other costs and expenses, attorneys' fees and disbursements, judgments (other than amounts paid or required to be paid to the Association itself), fines, and penalties and amounts paid in settlement (other than amounts paid or agreed to be paid to the Association itself), provided that, in the case of amounts paid in settlement, the amount thereof shall been been approved by a judicial or

such judgment or entering such plea has been negligent or guilty of misconduct in the performance of his duties as such Trustee or officer, or that the action complained of was not taken in good faith in the reasonable belief that it was in the best interest of this Association, or that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. </p><p class="P52">In the case of an adjudication in which the Trustee or officer involved is successful, he or she shall be entitled to indemnification as of right.  In all other cases in which the Trustee or officer involved may be entitled to indemnification by reason of the provisions of this Article IX, indemnification shall be made only upon either (a) the <span class="T24">determination</span> in writing of a majority of disinterested Trustees of the Association, where all of the disinterested Trustees <span class="T24">constitute</span> a majority of the whol<span class="T24">e</span> Board of Trustees, that the Trustee of officer in question was not negligent or guilty or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties and that he or she was acting in good faith in what he or she reasonably believed to be <span class="T24">in</span> the best interest of the Association and, in any matter the subject of a criminal action, suit, or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful, or (b) if one-half or more of the members of the Board of Trustees of the Association are parties to the claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation in question or for any other reason are not disinterested, a <span class="T24">determination</span> to the same effect as that set forth in the foregoing <span class="T24">clause</span> made by and set forth in a written advise of independent counsel, who may be the regular counsel of the Association, concurred in writing by a majority of the disinterested Trustees of the Association if there shall be any such.  In making the foregoing <span class="T24">determination</span>, a disinterested Trustee shall be entitled to place conclusive reliance upon the written advice of such counsel.  For purposes of this Article, a Trustee shall be considered disinterested unless he or she has, or at any time has had, an interes<span class="T24">t</span> adverse to the Association in the claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, or the subject matter or outcome thereof, in which event he or she shall be considered disinterested.  Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, if a <span class="T24">judicial</span> or administrative body determined as a part of the settlement of any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation that the Association should indemnify a Trustee or officer for the amount of the settlement, the Association shall indemnify the Trustee or officer for the amount of the settlement in accordance with such determination.  </p><p class="P49">Expenses incurred with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation of the character described in this Article may be advanced by the Association prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Trustee or officer to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined, under the procedure set forth in this Article, that he or she is not entitled to indemnification or, where indemnification is granted, to the extent the expenses so advanced exceed the indemnification to which he or she is entitled.  </p><p class="P49">The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights which any Trustee or officer may be or become entitled to by law or be lawfully granted by contract with the Association, by vote of the Members or otherwise.</p><p class="P49">In the discretion of the Board of Trustees, any other employee of the Association who is not a Trustee or officer thereof may be indemnified by the Association
