class="T52">5.01</span><span class="T51">     </span><span class="T9">Definitions of Assessments</span><span class="T51">.    </span><span class="T52">The term “Assessments” as used herein means any and all assessments, fees and costs that are levied pursuant to any provisions of Sections 5.02, 5.03 and 5.04 of this Declaration.</span></p><p class="P56"><span class="T51">5.02     </span><span class="T4">General Assessments</span><span class="T51">.     Each year, the Association, or Declarant, if Declarant owns a Lot in the Subdivision and has yet to relinquish its rights and responsibilities in connection with the Association, will establish the amount of the general assessment.  The Association shall levy and collect the same.  General assessments may be billed on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, as determined by the Association or Declarant, and shall be due and payable to the Association from the Owner of each Lot as and when directed by the Association.  The amount of the general assessments will be that amount that is sufficient to discharge anticipated costs and expenses of the maintenance, operation, and management associated with the Subdivision and the Association during the year as reasonably determined by the Association or Declarant plus a reserve amount not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount as determined by the Board.</span></p><p class="P55"><span class="T51">5.03     </span><span class="T4">Special Assessments</span><span class="T51">.     The Board may establish, levy, and collect special assessments at any time for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, renovation, repair, replacement, or addition of any improvement located in any common areas and common easements in the Development, which cost has not otherwise been provided for in the general assessment and provided that special assessments are approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Members of the Association.</span></p><p class="P55"><span class="T51">5.04     </span><span class="T4">Individual Lot Assessments</span><span class="T51">.     The Board may levy one or more individual lot assessments against a Lot and the Owner of the same to reimburse the Association for costs and expenses incurred by the Association arising from or related to the failure of the Owner and/or any of the Owner's family members, guests and/or invitees to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Declaration, the Code of Regulations and/or the rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, costs of </span><span class="T53">enforcement</span><span class="T51"> (including reasonabl</span><span class="T53">e</span><span class="T51"> attorney's fees)</span><span class="T53"> of the terms and conditions of this Declaration, the Code of Regulations, the rules and regulations and costs of additional insurance premiums, and/or costs and fines against an Owner and/or the Lot set forth in any provision of this Declaration, along with a penalty assessment to prevent future violations by the Owner and/or any of the Owner's family members, invitees and guests, as reasonably determined by the Board.  Upon the Board's determination to levy any individual lot assessment, the Board shall give the affected Owner written notice and the right to be heard by the Board or an appointed committee at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of an individual lot assessment.</span></p><p class="P52"><span class="T51">5.05     </span><span class="T4">Non-Payment of Assessments and Penalty Assessments</span><span class="T51">.     Any Assessments levied pursuant to this Declaration, which are not paid on the date when due shall be delinquent and shall, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent (10.0%) per annum compound on a monthly basis and the costs of the collection thereof including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees.</span></p><p class="P53"><span class="T51">5.06     </span><span class="T4">Liens</span><span class="T51">.     Any delinquent assessments and interest due thereon shall automatically be a lien upon the applicable Lot or said Owner (including improvements thereon).  If any Assessments remain unpaid for thirty (30) days after they become due and payable, the Association may file a certificate of lien, signed by a member of the Board or a manager, with the Licking County, Ohio Recorder's Office pursuant to the authorization given by the Board.  A certificate of lien shall contain a description of the Lot, the name </span><span class="T51">or names of the Owner(s) and the amount of the unpaid portion of the Assessment and late charges accrued as of the date of the certificate.  Any lien shall remain valid for a period of five (5) years and any renewals thereof, from the time of the filing thereof, unless sooner released or satisfied in the manner allowed by law for the release and satisfaction of mortgages in real property or discharged by the final judgment or order of a court of </span><span class="T54">competent</span><span class="T51"> jurisdiction.  If the Association </span><span class="T54">employs</span><span class="T51"> counsel to collect any lien or to otherwise collect any Assessments, the Owner or Lots shall pay all costs incurred in connection with the same, including a reasonable fee for counsel.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any lien by the Association upon a Lot shall be subordinate to the first mortgage on said property.  Sale or transfer of any Lot shall not affect the </span><span class="T54">attachment</span><span class="T51"> of the lien to the Lot.</span></p><p class="P54"><span class="T51">5.07     </span><span class="T4">Personal Liability</span><span class="T51">.     In addition, each Owner shall be personally liable for all amounts due under the provisions of this Article V for any Lot(s) owned by said Owner while an Owner.</span></p><p class="P50"><span class="T51">5.08     </span><span class="T4">Properties Exempt from Assessments</span><span class="T51">.     Assessments and any other fees of the Association shall only be assessed against Owners on which Houses are fully constructed and initially occupied for residential purposes.  The Association shall not assess or collect Assessments or fees from Declarant or any other Builder during such periods as Declarant or any other Builder owns any Lot within the Subdivision that has not been fully completed or occupied.</span></p><p class="P51"><span class="T51">5.09     </span><span class="T4">Declarant's Payment of Assessments</span><span class="T51">.     Declarant may elect to pay some or none of the “deficit”, which is the difference between the amount of Assessments assessed and the amount of actual expenditures of the Association during the fiscal year.  Declarant shall have no obligation to pay or fund any deficit of or to subsidize the Association.  Declarant's subsidy to the Association may be made in the form of cash and/or “in kind” contributions of services or materials, or a combination of these.  Those amounts paid or contributed by Declarant to subsidize the Association shall be credited first against current assessments owed by Declarant, if any, and them toward future Assessments that become owed by Declarant to the Association.  This Section 5.09 shall not be subject to amendment during any period when Declarant owns a Lot in the Subdivision.</span></p><p class="P35"><span

(ii) any special Assessments to pay for capital expenditures or interest expense on indebtedness incurred for the purpose of making capital expenditures and not projected to be paid out of the reserve fund (provided, however, that capital expenditures in excess of $5,000 shall be approved by at least two-thirds of the Members);

costs of additional insurance premiums specifically allocatable to an Owner; costs of any utility expenses chargeable to an Owner but not separately billed by the utility company; and all other fines and charges reasonably determined to be a Lot Assessment by the Board.  The Board also may levy a Lot Assessment in the nature of a fine reasonably determined by the Board against the Lot of any Owner who violoates the Rules adopted by the Board, the Association Documents or any provision of this Declaration, or who suffers or permits his/her family members, guests, invitees or tenants to violate such Rules, the Association Documents, or provisions of this Declaration.  Upon its determination to levy an individual Lot Assessment, the Board shall give the affected Owner(s) written notice and the right to be heard by the Board or a duly appointed committee thereof in connection with such Lot Assessment, 10 days prior to the effective date of the levy of any Lot Assessment.</span></span></p><p class="P44"><span> 5.02</span><span> <span class="T4">Interest: Late Charge</span>.     If any Assessment remains unpaid for 10 days after all or any part thereof shall become due and payable, the Board may charge interest at the lesser of the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum or the highest rate permitted by law, and the Board, or the Manager, if applicable, may collect an administrative collection charge in an amount to be established from time to time by the Board.</span></p><p class="P43"><span> 5.03</span><span> <span class="T4">Liability for Unpaid Assessments</span>.     Each Assessment or installment of an Assessment, together with interest ther<span class="T37">e</span>on and any costs of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees shall become the personal obligation of the Owner(s) beginning on the date the Assessment or installment thereof becomes due and payable.  The Board may authorize the Association to institute an action at law on behalf of the Association against the Owner(s) personally obligated to pay any delinquent Assessment.  An Owner's personal obligation for a Lot's delinquent Assessment shall also be the personal obligation of his/her successors in title who acquire an interest after any Assessment becomes due and payable and both such Owner and his/her successor in title shall be jointly and severally liable therefore.  Excepts as otherwise provided herein, the transfer of an interest in a Lot shall neither impair the Association's lien against that Lot for any delinquent Assessment nor prohibit the Association from foreclosing that lien.</span></p><p class="P43"><span> <span class="T37">5.04        </span><span class="T10">Liens</span><span class="T37">.     All unpaid Assessments, together with any interest and charges thereon or costs of collection, shall constitute a continuing charge in favor of the Association and a lien on the Lot against which the Assessment was levied.  If any Assessment remains unpaid for ten (10) days after it is due, then the Board may authorize any officer or appointed agent of the Association to file a certificate of lien for all or any part of the unpaid balance of the Assessment, together with interest and costs with the appropriate governmental office containing a description of the Lot which the lien encumbers, the name(s) of the Owner(s) of the Lot, the amount of the unpaid portion of the Assessment, and such other information as the laws of the State may require.  The certificate may be signed by any officer, authorized agent or Manager of the Association.  Upon the filing of the certificate, the subject Lot shall be encumbered by a continuing lien in favor of the Association.  The Assessment lien shall remain valid for a period of five (5) years from the date such certificate is duly filed, and may thereafter be renewed for like consecutive terms, until and unless the lien is released earlier or satisfied in the same manner provided by the law of the State for the release and satisfaction of the mortgages on real property, or unless the lien is discharged by the final judgment or order of any court having jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the lien for Assessments provided for in this Section shall be subordinate to the lien of any bona fide first mortgage on a lot.  </span></span></p><p class="P42"><span class="T26">        5.05        </span><span class="T27">Vote on Association Matters</span><span class="T26">:     Use of Common Area.  If any Assessment remains unpaid for thirty (3) days after it becomes due, then the delinquent Owner's voting rights upon Association matters and privileges to use the Common Area, except for necessary ingress and egress to his/her Lot, shall be suspended until such Assessment is paid.</span></strike></p><p class="P7"> </p>
